# Secrets and local environment setup

This guide explains how to configure LumenFlow locally without committing secrets,
and how to validate the Docker Compose stack.

## Environment files

`.env.example` is the only environment file tracked in git. It documents every
variable but contains no real values. Everything else is ignored:

```gitignore
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

To set up locally, copy the example to a network-specific file and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local      # local quickstart
cp .env.example .env.testnet    # testnet
cp .env.example .env.mainnet    # mainnet
```

Never commit `.env.local`, `.env.testnet`, or `.env.mainnet`. They are gitignored
on purpose.

## Which values are secret

| Variable          | Secret? | Notes                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETWORK`         | No      | `local` / `testnet` / `mainnet`.                                 |
| `RPC_URL`         | No      | Public RPC endpoint.                                             |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | No   | Public, fixed per network.                                       |
| `SOURCE_ACCOUNT`  | **Yes** | Stellar secret key (starts with `S`). Pays deployment fees.      |
| `CONTRACT_ID`     | No      | Public, populated after deploy.                                  |
| `ADMIN_ADDRESS`   | No      | Public key (`G...`).                                             |

Only `SOURCE_ACCOUNT` is sensitive. Treat it like a password.

## Handling the source secret key safely

- Keep `SOURCE_ACCOUNT` in your gitignored `.env.<network>` file or pass it
  inline for one-off commands; do not hardcode it in scripts, the `Makefile`, or
  source.
- Use a dedicated **testnet** key for day-to-day work. Fund it from the
  [testnet friendbot](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test).
- For mainnet, store the key in a password manager or OS keychain and export it
  into the shell only for the deploy command:

  ```bash
  NETWORK=mainnet SOURCE_ACCOUNT="$(read -rs k; echo "$k")" ./scripts/deploy.sh
  ```

- Use separate keys per network so a leaked testnet key never affects mainnet.
- Never echo the secret in CI logs; pass it through the CI provider's secret store.

The deploy scripts read the key from the environment, so it never needs to be
written to a tracked file:

```bash
SOURCE_ACCOUNT=<secret-key> ./scripts/local_up.sh
NETWORK=testnet SOURCE_ACCOUNT=<testnet-secret-key> ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Validating Docker Compose

Validate the compose file before bringing the stack up:

```bash
docker compose config        # prints the resolved config, errors on problems
docker compose up -d stellar # start the local Stellar quickstart node
```

`docker compose config` resolves and type-checks `docker-compose.yml`. The
committed compose file contains no secrets; it only sets the public `NETWORK`
value for the local quickstart node, so it is safe to commit as-is.
