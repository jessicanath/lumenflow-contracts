# LumenFlow Events Reference

This document provides a detailed reference for all events emitted by the LumenFlow smart contract. These events are essential for off-chain indexers and user interfaces to track the state of payments, refunds, and merchant registrations.

## Event Structure

All events in LumenFlow follow the Soroban event standard.
- **Contract ID**: The address of the deployed LumenFlow contract.
- **Topics**: The first topic is always the symbol `lumenflow`. The second topic is the event name (e.g., `payment_processed`).
- **Data**: A single XDR-encoded value (can be a tuple, struct, or primitive).

## Subscribing to Events

You can subscribe to LumenFlow events using any Stellar SDK or by querying Horizon/RPC directly.

### Via Stellar RPC (Recommended)
Soroban-RPC provides the `getEvents` method to query events within a ledger range.

**Example Request (JSON-RPC):**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getEvents",
  "params": {
    "startLedger": 123456,
    "filters": [
      {
        "type": "contract",
        "contractIds": ["C...CONTRACT_ID"],
        "topics": [["AAAABAAAABlsdW1lbmZsb3cAAAA="]] 
      }
    ],
    "pagination": { "limit": 10 }
  }
}
```
*Note: `AAAABAAAABlsdW1lbmZsb3cAAAA=` is the base64 XDR for the symbol `lumenflow`.*

### Via Horizon
While Soroban-RPC is preferred for real-time Soroban events, Horizon also exposes them via the `/events` endpoint if the ingestion is configured.

## Decoding XDR Payloads

Events data is returned as XDR. To decode it in JavaScript using `stellar-sdk`:

```javascript
import { xdr, scValToNative } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';

// Example: Decoding payment_processed data
const rawData = "AAAAE... (base64 XDR)";
const scVal = xdr.ScVal.fromXDR(rawData, 'base64');
const nativeData = scValToNative(scVal);

console.log(nativeData); 
// Output: ["ORDER_123", "G...PAYER", "G...MERCHANT", 1000n]
```
